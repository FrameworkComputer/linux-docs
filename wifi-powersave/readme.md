```

or

### Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install curl -y
```

## To Install Ethernet Diagnostic Script, simply run:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FrameworkComputer/linux-docs/main/wifi-powersave/powersave.sh -o powersave.sh && clear && bash powersave.sh
```

Running the script in the future
After the install, you can run going forward with the following in the HOME directory. So merely opening a terminal and running this will work if the original script has not been moved.

```
bash powersave.sh
```
