### Bonus Step (for former Mac users) Reduce Font Scaling to Match Your Needs

We received feedback that for users coming from OS X, installing GNOME Tweaks, browsing to Fonts, and reducing the font size from 1.00 to 0.80 may be preferred. 

- Goto Displays, set scaling to 200%. This will look too large, so let's fix the fonts.
- Install with:
  
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gnome-tweaks -y
```

- Open Tweaks by using the "Super" or Windows key, search tweaks, and enter.

- At the top, select fonts. Now in that panel, scroll all the way down. Look for Size. Change from 1.00 to 0.80. Close Tweaks.

  Note: This is for the displays for the laptop only. This will look super odd on external displays and likely too large even still.
