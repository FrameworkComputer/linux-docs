Curl should already be installed.
But just in case:

Fedora
```
sudo dnf install curl -y
```

or

Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install curl -y
```

Then run

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FrameworkComputer/linux-docs/main/log-helper/combined.sh && clear && sh combined.sh
```
After the install, you can run going forward with the following in the HOME direcotory. So merely opening a terminal and running this will work if the original script has not been moved.

```
sh combined.sh
```
