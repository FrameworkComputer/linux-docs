### Which distros does this work on?

**This tool works with all major Linux distributions and automatically installs required packages:**

- **Ubuntu/Debian/Linux Mint** (officially supported by Framework)
- **Fedora** (officially supported by Framework) 
- **Bazzite/Project Bluefin** (officially supported by Framework)

### How to use this tool?

#### Prerequisites

Most systems already have curl installed. If needed:

**Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf install curl -y
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install curl -y
```

**Bazzite/Bluefin:** Already included, no installation needed.

#### Quick Start

**Download and run the diagnostic tool:**
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FrameworkComputer/linux-docs/main/log-helper/combined.sh -o combined.sh && chmod +x combined.sh && bash combined.sh
```

**For future runs:**
```bash
./combined.sh
```

### Diagnostic Options

#### 1. Last X Minutes ‚è∞
**Best for recent issues**

- Select option `1`
- Enter the number of minutes (e.g., `30` for issues that happened 30 minutes ago)
- The tool will analyze logs from that timeframe and provide recommendations

![Last X Minutes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FrameworkComputer/linux-docs/refs/heads/main/log-helper/images/1.png "Last X Minutes")

![Finshed scan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FrameworkComputer/linux-docs/refs/heads/main/log-helper/images/2.png "Finshed scan")

**Example use cases:**
- Graphics crashed while gaming
- WiFi suddenly disconnected
- System became unresponsive
- Thermal throttling during heavy workload

#### 2. Last 24 Hours üìÖ
**Best for ongoing or intermittent issues**

- Select option `2`
- Analyzes the full day of system logs
- Identifies patterns like recurring WiFi drops or thermal cycling

**Example use cases:**
- Random system freezes throughout the day
- Intermittent USB connection issues
- Gradual performance degradation
- Battery or charging problems

#### 3. Specific Time Range üéØ
**Best when you know exactly when the issue occurred**

- Select option `3`
- Enter start time: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` (24-hour format)
- Enter end time: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`

**Example:**
- Start: `2025-01-15 14:30` (Jan 15, 2:30 PM)
- End: `2025-01-15 15:00` (Jan 15, 3:00 PM)

#### 4. Filter Previously Created Log File üîç
**For advanced analysis of existing logs**

- Run after creating a log file with options 1-3
- Search for specific keywords or phrases
- Creates `filtered_log.txt` with matching entries

### Understanding the Results

The diagnostic tool creates `combined_log.txt` with several sections:

#### üîß System Information
- Framework model detection
- Hardware specifications (GPU, WiFi, RAM, storage)
- Current temperatures and power status
- Linux distribution compatibility status

#### ‚ö° Intelligent Recommendations
**Color-coded by severity:**

- **üî¥ IMMEDIATE**: Stop using immediately (dangerous temperatures, hardware faults)
- **üü† URGENT**: Address soon (GPU crashes, memory issues, storage problems)
- **üü° IMPORTANT**: Should fix (USB issues, WiFi problems, audio issues)
- **üîµ INFORMATIONAL**: Status updates (distro compatibility, normal thermal behavior)
- **üü¢ PREVENTIVE**: Proactive suggestions (elevated temperatures, minor issues)

#### üìä Pattern Analysis
- WiFi stability (tracks disconnection frequency)
- USB connection reliability
- GPU stability monitoring
- Thermal management effectiveness

#### üéØ Framework-Specific Features

**Model-Aware Recommendations:**
- Framework Laptop 13: 60W charger verification
- Framework Laptop 16: 180W charger verification + GPU module checks
- Framework Desktop: Power supply diagnostics
- Expansion card troubleshooting

**Thermal Management:**
- Modern AMD (7040+ series): Higher temperature tolerance (95¬∞C normal)
- Intel processors: Conservative thresholds (80¬∞C watch point)
- Model-specific cooling guidance

**Hardware Detection:**
- MediaTek WiFi cards (MT7922/MT7925)
- Intel WiFi cards (iwlwifi)
- AMD GPUs (RDNA 2/3)
- Intel integrated graphics
- Framework expansion cards

- Repeated GPU crashes or system freezes
- Hardware fault messages (Machine Check, MCE errors)
- Persistent thermal issues despite cleaning

**Include these files with your support ticket:**
- `combined_log.txt` (the full diagnostic report)
- Screenshots of any error messages
- Description of when the issue occurs

### Quick Commands

After running the diagnostic:

```bash
# View full report
cat combined_log.txt

# View only recommendations
grep -A 20 "INTELLIGENT RECOMMENDATIONS" combined_log.txt

# Monitor temperatures in real-time
watch -n 2 sensors

# Check current system status
sensors
```
