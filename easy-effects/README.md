## FAQ

- Can you run both of these to compare them?
> Yes, you can. Nothing is overwritten, it will just try to install the flatpack twice which is fine and affects nothing.

- Do you need to look for the profile once it's installed?
> Nope, just follow the iamge. It's browsed for you, just load it.

- I'd rather load this manually. How?
> We're going to reocmmend the automated method, but if you on our own, wish to do this:
> - Install Easy Effects.
> - Download the json file you wish to use.
> - Browse to it from the present menu.
