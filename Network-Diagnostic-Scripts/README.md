  >Use Wifi‑Diagnostic.sh when you want a broad view of your Wi‑Fi health (interfaces, speed, VPN, overall environment).
  
  >Use 5ghz‑diag.sh when you need to deeply troubleshoot why your system isn’t seeing or staying on 5 GHz/6 GHz (reg domains, PHY capabilities, DFS, band‑steering, driver/firmware issues).

## To Install Ethernet Diagnostic Script, simply run:
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FrameworkComputer/linux-docs/main/Network-Diagnostic-Scripts/Ethernet-Diagnostic.sh -o Ethernet-Diagnostic.sh && clear && bash Ethernet-Diagnostic.sh
```

Running the script in the future
After the install, you can run going forward with the following in the HOME directory. So merely opening a terminal and running this will work if the original script has not been moved.

```
bash Ethernet-Diagnostic.sh

## To Install 5Ghz/6Ghz Frequency Diagnostic Tool, simply run:
**Important:** The images below are merely the bottom half of the data piped out into a log file into your home directory. They only reflect a brief summary of the findings.
You cam take the completed log to get help from the support team.

This script is a comprehensive diagnostic tool specifically designed to troubleshoot issues related to 5GHz (and 6GHz) WiFi connections on Linux systems, including those using immutable distributions like Bazzite and Project Bluefin. It automates the collection of detailed information about your wireless hardware, software configuration, and network environment to help identify potential problems preventing successful connection or optimal performance on faster WiFi bands.


```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FrameworkComputer/linux-docs/refs/heads/main/Network-Diagnostic-Scripts/5ghz-diag.sh -o 5ghz-diag.sh && clear && sudo bash 5ghz-diag.sh
```

Running the tool in the future
After the install, you can run going forward with the following in the HOME directory. So merely opening a terminal and running this will work if the original script has not been moved.


```
sudo bash 5ghz-diag.sh
```

- Checks for pending reboots: Determines if a system reboot is required, especially relevant after installing dependencies on immutable systems.
- Verifies sudo privileges: Checks if the script is run with administrative privileges, noting that some features require sudo for full functionality.
- Installs missing dependencies: Identifies and offers to install necessary command-line tools (iw, nmcli, ip) using the appropriate package manager for your distribution (immutable or traditional).
- Displays Regulatory Domain Information: Shows the configured wireless regulatory domain, which can impact available channels and power levels.
- Detects Network Interface: Identifies your primary wireless network interface.
- Reports Hardware Capabilities: Provides details about your wireless card, including supported WiFi bands (2.4GHz, 5GHz, 6GHz), frequencies, and features (like HT, VHT, HE, 160MHz, DFS).
- Shows Current Connection Status: Displays information about your current WiFi connection, including SSID, frequency, signal strength, and transfer rates.
- Scans for 5GHz Networks: Lists available 5GHz (and 6GHz) wireless networks in your vicinity, including their frequency, signal strength, security type, and BSSID (requires sudo).

### FAQ

- Does this fix anything with networking?
>This is a tool to give you and if need be, Framework Support an idea of what your network looks like. It also provides critical guidence on power save state, VPN usage, speed testing results, and overall network environment which may indicate where a problem is happening.


- Will this tell me why my network is so slow?
>Indirectly, yes. It can indicate items such as frequency, crowded wifi channels, among a number of other variables to examine. VPNs are a huge one.

- Does this support Project Bluefin or Bazzite?
>I have specific scripts in testing for these distros. We will be using Homebrew for them. Will update this repo when they are ready.

- Does this work for a laptop whereas I cannot use the internet at all?
>No. This is for performance issues specifically. That said, if you download the file onto another computer, move it to the Framework Laptop that is lacking internet, the wifi script will provide some hints as to what might be going on and how to fix it.

- My wifi card keeps dropping out.
> Please use [this script](https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/network-tester?tab=readme-ov-file#mediatekintel-wi-fi-drop-tester), run it for one hour. It will tell you when it's done running. Grab both the ping_logfile.log and iw_logfile.log logs it creates in your home directory and send it to support. This should capture the timeout and indicate if there was a signal drop, frequency change or another event.
