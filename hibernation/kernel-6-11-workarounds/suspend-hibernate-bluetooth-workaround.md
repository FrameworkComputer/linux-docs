## THIS IS NO LONGER NEEDED. 
If you need to undo this workaround, [simply visit this section](https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/linux-docs/blob/main/hibernation/kernel-6-11-workarounds/suspend-hibernate-bluetooth-workaround.md#to-remove-the-services-installed) and run the commands to remove the service(s).
# Workaround for suspend/hibernate black screen on resume kernel 6.11

- ~~Issue: Bluetooth on kernel 6.11 causes black screen on resume attempt when using a MediaTek Wi-Fi card.~~
- ~~Workaround provides two systemd services. First one rfkills Bluetooth when suspend or hibernate is detected. Second service re-activates Bluetooth upon resume.~~

### ~~Install Curl~~

~~Curl should already be installed, but just in case:~~

### Fedora
```
sudo dnf install curl -y
```

~~or~~

~~### Ubuntu~~
```
sudo apt install curl -y
```

## ~~To Install rfkill-suspender Script, simply run:~~

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FrameworkComputer/linux-docs/refs/heads/main/hibernation/kernel-6-11-workarounds/rfkill-suspender.sh -o rfkill-suspender.sh && clear && bash rfkill-suspender.sh
```

~~Running the script in the future~~
~~After the install, you can run going forward with the following in the HOME directory. So merely opening a terminal and running this will work if the original script has not been moved.~~

```
bash rfkill-suspender.sh
```
