# Framework Laptop 16 (AMD Ryzenâ„¢ AI 300 Series) ONLY

## This will:

- Get your laptop fully updated
- Enable improved fractional scaling support in Fedora's GNOME environment using Wayland
- Enable tap to click on the touchpad
- Prepare your system for gaming with hardware dGPU support as the next step (end of this article)

### Bonus Step: Reduce Font Scaling (For Former Mac Users)

For users coming from macOS, installing GNOME Tweaks and adjusting font scaling may provide a more familiar experience:

- Go to Displays, set scaling to 200% (this will look too large initially)
- Install GNOME Tweaks:
  
```
sudo dnf install gnome-tweaks -y
```

- Open Tweaks by pressing the "Super" (Windows) key, search "tweaks", and press enter
- At the top, select "Fonts". Scroll down to find "Scaling Factor"
- Change from 1.00 to 0.80, then close Tweaks

**Note:** This scaling adjustment is optimized for the laptop display only and may not look optimal on external monitors.
