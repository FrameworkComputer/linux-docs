# WiFi Mesh Network Analyzer

### Why does the WiFi Mesh Network Analyzer exist?

Modern mesh Wi-Fi networks promise better coverage, seamless roaming, and smarter performance‚Äîbut when something goes wrong, most users are left guessing. The WiFi Mesh Network Analyzer exists to fill that gap. It gives Linux users real insight into how their mesh network is actually behaving: how nodes are connected, where overlap happens, which connections are weak, and how your device is steering between access points.

Mesh networks aren't always transparent. Commercial mesh systems often hide diagnostics behind limited apps or cloud dashboards, making it hard to understand why performance drops or devices fail to roam correctly. This tool was created to surface that data directly from the network and make it human-readable‚Äîwithout needing vendor lock-in or proprietary software.

It's especially helpful for troubleshooting issues like:

- Devices sticking to weak access points
- Random roaming between nodes
- Coverage dead zones or overlap
- Signal strength instability
- Micro-dropouts and connection interruptions
- WiFi power management problems causing false disconnects

Whether you're a developer, power user, or just someone trying to improve home or office Wi-Fi, the WiFi Mesh Network Analyzer provides a practical, no-nonsense way to visualize and understand your wireless environment using tools that respect Linux-first workflows.

In short: it exists because mesh Wi-Fi is powerful‚Äîbut only if you can actually see what's going on.

### TROUBLESHOOTING

"No WiFi interface found"

`nmcli device status`                          # Check available interfaces
`ip link show`                                 # List all network interfaces

**0 access points found:**

- You may be on a restricted enterprise network
- Ensure you have proper WiFi scanning permissions; sudo
- Try moving closer to mesh nodes or access points

**Permission errors:**

- Must run with sudo for WiFi scanning
- Files are automatically created with correct user permissions
- Roaming and power analysis require elevated privileges

**Module import errors:**

- Ensure all 5 Python files are in the same directory
- Check file permissions and execute bits
- Optional modules (roaming_detector, power_detective) will gracefully degrade if missing

**Roaming analysis issues:**

- Requires active mesh network connection
- Best results when moving between different coverage areas
- May need multiple test runs for comprehensive data

**Power management detection:**

- Some issues require specific hardware configurations
- Results vary by WiFi chipset and driver version
- Generated fix scripts should be reviewed before execution

#### Why some nodes or frequencies might not appear

Not all mesh nodes or Wi-Fi frequencies will always show up in scans. This is expected behavior due to how mesh networks operate and how wireless scanning works on Linux. Some reasons include:

- Background steering and band steering: Mesh systems often hide certain nodes or bands (like 5GHz backhaul links) from active scans to manage traffic automatically.

- Scan timing limitations: Some nodes may only broadcast intermittently or reduce beaconing when idle, so they can be missed in a single scan.

- Driver and chipset behavior: Certain Wi-Fi chipsets or drivers (especially on Linux) may not report all frequencies or channels reliably during passive or active scans.

- DFS channels (Dynamic Frequency Selection): Some 5GHz channels are restricted and may not be immediately visible due to regulatory delays or scanning restrictions.

- Power management: Nodes may be in power-saving modes that reduce visibility.

If you're troubleshooting, try running multiple scans over time, use the new roaming analysis features, or reposition your device to improve visibility. This tool captures what the system can see‚Äîbut some things are designed to stay just out of sight.

### PRO TIPS

- **Best results**: Connect to the mesh network you want to analyze

- **Large mesh networks**: May take longer to scan (15-30 seconds)

- **Enterprise networks**: Some corporate networks block WiFi scanning

- **Multiple runs**: Historical data improves recommendations over time

- **Roaming analysis**: Use --roaming-test while walking around your space for comprehensive results

- **Test Power management**: Run --check-power if experiencing frequent disconnects or connection drops

- **HTML reports**: Best viewed in modern browsers with JavaScript enabled for full interactivity

- **Mobile viewing**: HTML reports are fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices

- **Data persistence**: All analysis data is saved locally for privacy and historical tracking

- **Background monitoring**: Use --monitor for long-term network health tracking and pattern analysis

- **Micro-dropout detection**: Use --detect-dropouts to catch brief connection issues that might not appear in system logs

- **Fix script safety**: Always review generated power management fix scripts before execution
